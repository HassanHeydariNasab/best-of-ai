## Adding a tool via PR

Each tool is a Markdown file in `content/tools/`. Create a new file named after the tool's slug:

```
content/tools/my-tool.md
```

With this front matter:

```yaml
---
title: 'My Tool'
name: 'My Tool'
slug: 'my-tool'
description: 'One or two sentences describing what the tool does.'
website: 'https://mytool.com'
logo_url: ''
category: 'productivity'
category_name: 'Productivity'
price: 'Freemium'
featured: false
date: '2025-01-01'
---
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | ✅ | Display name of the tool |
| `slug` | ✅ | URL-safe, lowercase, hyphens — must match filename |
| `description` | ✅ | 1–2 sentences, factual, no marketing fluff |
| `website` | ✅ | Full URL including `https://` |
| `category` | ✅ | Slug of an existing category in `data/categories.yaml` |
| `category_name` | ✅ | Human-readable category name (must match) |
| `price` | ✅ | One of: `Free`, `Freemium`, `Paid` |
| `logo_url` | — | Direct URL to a square logo image |
| `featured` | — | `true` for highlighted tools (default `false`) |
| `date` | — | Date added, `YYYY-MM-DD` |

### Guidelines

- **Quality over quantity** — the goal is a curated list, not a complete directory. Tools should be genuinely useful and notable.
- **No self-promotion** — don't submit your own tool unless it's already well-known in the community.
- **Accurate pricing** — use `Freemium` when there's a meaningful free tier, `Paid` when there's no free usage.
- **Neutral descriptions** — describe what the tool does, not how great it is.
- **One tool per PR** — keeps review fast and history clean.

## Adding a category

Categories are defined in `data/categories.yaml`. Each entry looks like:

```yaml
-
  id: 99
  name: 'My Category'
  description: 'Short description of what belongs here.'
  slug: 'my-category'
  sort_order: 0
```

- Use `sort_order: 1–20` for top-level categories that should appear first.
- Use `sort_order: 0` for everything else (sorted alphabetically).

## Running locally

**Prerequisites:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and Python 3.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/best-of-ai/best-of-ai.git
cd best-of-ai

# Preview the website
hugo server
# → open http://localhost:1313/

# Regenerate README from content files
python3 scripts/generate-readme.py
```

If you have a fresh SQL export to import:

```bash
python3 scripts/import-data.py
```

---

## How README auto-update works

On every push to `main` that touches `content/tools/`, `data/categories.yaml`, or `scripts/generate-readme.py`, the [Update README](.github/workflows/update-readme.yml) workflow runs `generate-readme.py` and commits the updated `README.md` back automatically.

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Submissions and reviews should be about the tools and the data, not the people.
